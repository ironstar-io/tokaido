/*

functions in this file are responsible for finding and removing legacy SSL
certificate configurations.

Tokaido has had three certificate generations:

- "tokaido.local" was a simple self-signed cert for Tokaido versions before 1.0
  previous logic existed to remove this from Tokaido 1 to 1.11.
- "local.tokaido.io" was a Certificate Authority that can be added to browsers and
  the macOS keychain as a trusted certificate. It signed *.local.tokaido.io but
  relied on a very clunky implentation of CloudFlare's `cfssl` library
- "Tokaido Local Certficiate Authority" is the current implementation that uses
  smarter generation logic to create TLS certificates for both the main
  *.local.tokaido.io wildcard cert used by the Proxy container, but also for
  individual certs for things like 'haproxy' and other future TLS implementations
  like signed MariaDB connections.
